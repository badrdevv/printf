A README.md file for our team project 0x11. C - printf, it is a group project that has about 16 tasks, those tasks give us some informations to implement the printf function, and try to handle different conversion specifiers like %d (decimal), %s (string), etc....
you'll find also some functions that handle custom conversion specifiers made by us, example: %b which is the binary format specifier that convert an unsigned int argument to binary, we will handle the flag characers for non-custom conversion specifiers like: +, space, #, additionally, there are more functions that handle length modifiers, field width, precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project.
